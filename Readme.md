## Setup

To set up the project, first clone the repository. Then follow the steps below to configure the API and mobile servers.


#### Api
Navigate to the `api` directory and install the dependencies using

```bash
npm install
```

Then run the server with
```bash
npm start
```

The api will not be running locally.


#### Mobile

Navigate to the `mobile` directory and install the dependencies using

```bash
npm install
```

Then in the `mobile` directory, create a file called `.env`. 
Add the following variable to it, replacing the string with the URL of your API server.

```bash
EXPO_PUBLIC_API_HOST=http://IP:PORT
```

Finally start the app with:
```bash
npx expo start
```

Follow the [Expo Go documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/set-up-your-environment/) and use either an emulator on your computer, or your physical phone to run the app.
